          Hi Everyone, I'm an enthusiastic student exploring artificial
          intelligence through the Governor of Pakistan's Generative AI
          Initiative. I'm learning TypeScript, Python, Next.js, HTML, and CSS,
          and I'm passionate about leveraging technology to solve real-world
          problems. As a new front-end developer, I'm excited to dive into the
          intersection of AI, programming, and innovation, with the goal of
          making a meaningful impact in the tech world.
